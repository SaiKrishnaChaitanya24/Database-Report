# Principles of Database Management Systems - Report

In this project, our aim is to create a web-based user interface for the database schema from the
first part of the project. For this, we implemented a web application on the concept of theme park
that provides various kinds of entertainment to people of all ages. Theme Park has different
attractions, shows, and stores for the visitors. It also has a parking facility for visitors. Our
application allows the visitors to book the tickets and pay online. It stores the database of all the
bookings, payments, and visitors to each entertainment.



In addition to the services mentioned above the theme park would also allow visitors to sign up
and login to their account and manage access authorizations of diverse groups of users.
